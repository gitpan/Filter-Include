Filter/Include version 1.6
==========================

Take the "#include" preproccesor directive from "C", stir in some "perl"
semantics and we have this module. Only one keyword is used, "include",
which is really just a processor directive for the filter, which indicates
the file to be included. The argument supplied to "include" will be handled
like it would by "require" and "use" so @INC is searched accordingly and
%INC is populated.
