Filter/Include version 0.1
==========================

Simple filter to emulate #include from C<C>. That is, the source of a given file
is dumped right directly into where the #include was, sort of like a brutish
C<require>. This is relatively stable, and if you're comfortable with source
filtering then it should be ready to put in production code.
